# Personal Finance Tracker (WIP)

This project was generated via ChatGPT.

This is a web application for tracking personal finances, including income, expenses, and investments. Users can link their bank accounts and credit cards, view reports and visualizations of their financial data, and customize their settings and preferences.

- CSS Grid and Flexbox for responsive design
- Chart libraries like Recharts or D3.js for data visualization
- Firebase authentication for user authentication and authorization
- Plaid API for bank account and credit card linking and data retrieval
